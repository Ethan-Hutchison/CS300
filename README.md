# CS300
For this prject the goal was to create a system that can use a data structure to load courses from a courses list, sort them in alphanumeric order and let the user print the whole list or search for a course.
To solve this problem I learned about and compared data types and then create a program to use one of those data types and store the data needed. Data structures are important because they make it easier to store and sort through data.
To help get through any road blocks during the project I used resourses I had to review anything that I needed and also looked online if there were any issues I needed a little help with.
This project has helped me learn about the different structures and how to use them which gives me a whole new toolset for anything I have to deal with in the future.
